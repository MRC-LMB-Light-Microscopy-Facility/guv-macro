Analyse the fluorescence intensity on beads Usage:- Open the original files in FIJI- Select all beads to analyse: draw circular ROIs around the beads in the mCherry channel and press 't' to save each ROI in the ROI Manager- Launch the macro- Adjust the width of the area to measure. The width is measured in pixels, extending towards the centre of the circular ROI. - Results will show intensity in each channel- Copy the intensity values for the mCherry and AF488 channels into Excel- Measure 10 empty areas with no beads using the same procedure- Average the readings from 10 empty areas and subtract from the intensities of the beads. This will correct for background intensity.- Divide the AF488 channel intensity by the mCherry channel intensity. This should normalise the effect of unequal loading of the protein on the beads.
